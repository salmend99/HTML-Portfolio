<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a software developer with a strong foundation in Python and a passion for building impactful digital solutions. I'm currently enhancing my full-stack development skills through Dr. Angela Yu’s Web Development Bootcamp, where I'm working on modern web projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.</p>

<p>My background combines both technical and analytical strengths. I hold a degree in Finance and Economics and have hands-on experience in financial analysis and accounting. This unique combination allows me to approach programming challenges with both precision and strategic insight.</p>

<p>In addition to web development, I'm diving deep into data science. I'm enrolled in Harvard’s edX Data Science Professional Certificate program, where I'm learning to clean, analyze, and visualize data using R and statistical modeling techniques. I'm also self-teaching how to implement linear regression and predictive analytics using Jupyter Notebooks and Python-based libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.</p>

<p>My goal is to build robust, data-driven applications that solve real-world problems and make a measurable impact. I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and tackling new challenges in tech.</p>
